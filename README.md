View the live website [here](michaelmkrtch.github.io/swipe/)

This website was built using HTML, CSS, and JS. The primary CSS topics covered include flexbox, grid, `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements, and animations.

This website was built as part of the Final Project of Colt Steele's HTML & CSS Bootcamp. It is based off of Stripe and uses their website for inspiration. The hero section animated gradient is from [this](https://codepen.io/smitpatelx/pen/GRZayyO) CodePen.
